# hot-stuff
Altered DLL for Date Everything (Requested).
Modifies your stats to be maxed out, for those who think grinding them is boring.
Will not change anything else about the game.

The game will think you have already played, as the stats are maxed. They are visually at 0, until something adds to them (Minus the armor from the DLC)

Either compile it yourself, or just download the DLL and put it in:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Date Everything\Date Everything_Data\Managed"

Overwrite the existing Assembly-CSharp.dll.


If an update breaks it, make an issue.
